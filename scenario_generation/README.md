Each of these folder contains a procedure to generate scenarios ie. set of radar and AIS time which time-aligned

- The **random** procedure is the simpliest, it uses randomly generated data

- The **sampling** procedure is generated synthetic data with a trajectory generation algorithm based on the Kalman filter

- The **real data** procedure is working with real AIS data collected on the terrain, it preproceses these data in order to ensure that they are time-aligned
